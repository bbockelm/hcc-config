# Certain Torque versions, starting with 2.4.6, don't support the
# multiple stagein/stagout directive documented in the qsub manpage due to a 
# bug.
# As a safe recipe for automatically detecting this condition at runtime cannot
# be established, this is left to manual configuration.
# Setting this attribute to 'yes' -should- be compatible with older
# Torque versions, but may be failing with PBSpro.
# A new setting ('multiline') triggers an undocumented syntax
# which is reported to be compatible with most Torque version:
# use it as failback solution if neither 'yes' nor 'no' works for you.
