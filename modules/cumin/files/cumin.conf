# If a configuration section does not set a value for 
# a particular parameter, the parameter is searched for 
# in the [common] section.  This allows values to be set
# globally and then optionally overridden per section.  
# For example, to set the 'persona' value to grid for every 
# web section in the file, you may add 'persona: grid' 
# to the common section.

# *************** Some parameter explanations by section ***************

# [common]

# log-max-mb: 10
# Maximum size in MB of *.log files created by cumin.
# A log file reaching maximum size will be rolled over.
# A value of 0 leaves the log file size unlimited.

# log-max-archives: 1
# Number of rolled over log files to retain.  A retained
# log file will have a "." and a number added to its name.
# A value of 0 will cause a log file to be truncated
# rather than renamed if it reaches maximum size.

# [web]

# persona: default
# Controls content of the top level page.
# Valid values are "default", "grid", and "messaging".
# The default persona contains content for both grid and
# messaging.

# [data]

# expire-enabled: True
# Whether or not the instance runs a thread which periodically expires samples.
# Running the expire thread from more than one instance is okay but unnecessary

# expire-interval: 3600
# How often the expire thread runs, in seconds

# expire-threshold: 86400
# The maximum age of a sample in seconds.  If it's older, it will be deleted when
# the expire thread runs.

# vacuum-enabled: True
# Whether or not the instance runs a thread which periodically vacuums the
# database.  Running the vacuum thread from more than one instance is okay but
# unnecessary.

# vacuum-interval: 3600
# How often the vacuum thread runs, in seconds

# include-classes: [all]
# A comma separated list of QMF classes.  The default value is all
# classes in all packages. The cumin-data instance will be bound to 
# classes which appear in 'include-classes' but do not appear in 
# 'exclude-classes'.  Classes are specified as package:class for a single 
# class or package:* for all classes in a package.

# exclude-classes: [empty list]
# A comma separated list of QMF classes.  The default value is
# an empty list. The cumin-data instance will be bound to 
# classes which appear in 'include-classes' but do not appear in 
# 'exclude-classes'.  Classes are specified as package:class for a single 
# class or package:* for all classes in a package.

# [master]

# webs: web
# Comma separated list of sections in this file.
# Each section specifies the configuration for a separate
# instance of cumin-web.

# datas: data
# Comma separated list of sections in this file.
# Each section specifies the configuration for a separate
# instance of cumin-data.
