Puppet module: fetch-crl

DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages fetch-crl.
It's based on Example42's module structure and features standard and
extended classes for automatic monitoring, backup and firewalling.

All the variables used in this module are defined in the fetch-crl::params class
(File: $MODULEPATH/fetch-crl/manifests/params.pp). Here you can:
- Set default settings and filtering module's specific Users variables
- Add selectors for internal variables to adapt the module to different OSes
- Review and eventually change default settings for variables that affect the
  Example42 extended classes.

Customizations for different projects and logic on how to populate configuration
files should be placed in the $my_project classes.


MODULE'S SPECIFIC USER VARIABLES:


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include fetch-crl              # Install and run fetch-crl 

include fetch-crl::disable     # Disable fetch-crl service.
include fetch-crl::disableboot # Disable fetch-crl service at boot time, but don't stop if is running.
include fetch-crl::absent      # Remove fetch-crl package.
include fetch-crl::debug       # Used for debugging purposes (not resource hungry)
                         # Automatically included if $debug=yes
                         # Requires Example42's puppet::params and puppet::debug

# Extended Classes (generally require storeconfigs)
include fetch-crl::monitor     # Monitor fetch-crl
                         # Automatically included if $monitor=yes
                         # Requires Example42's monitor module
include fetch-crl::backup      # Backup fetch-crl data
                         # Automatically included if $backup=yes
                         # Requires Example42's backup module
include fetch-crl::firewall    # Manages firewall rules for fetch-crl service
                         # Automatically included if $firewall=yes
                         # Requires Example42's firewall module

# Generic define to set parameters in the main configuration file. EXPERIMENTAL.
fetch-crl::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} # Generic 

# Module specific classes

EXAMPLE42 GENERAL VARIABLES:
Example42 modules collection uses some general variables that can influence the
behaviour of this module. You can happily live without considering or setting them,
but they can be useful to get many useful features out of the box.
$my_project - If set, permits you to alter and customize the module behaviour
  and files's deploy logic in custom project classes
$my_project_onmodule - If set to yes your project classes are looked in a
  dedicated project module:
  - $my_project_onmodule not set -> Module autoloads fetch-crl::$my_module
                                    (MODULEPATH/fetch-crl/manifests/$my_project.pp)
  - $my_project_onmodule == yes  -> Module autoloads $my_module::fetch-crl
                                    (MODULEPATH/$my_project/manifests/fetch-crl.pp)
$base_source - Lets you define an alternative source for static files:
  - $base_source not set -> Files are looked in puppet://$servername/ (the PuppetMaster)
  - $base_source set -> Files are in $base_source ( Ex: puppet://$servername/$my_module ) 
  Note that the module automatically manages the different paths for Puppet pre 0.25
$debug - If set to yes writes in /var/lib/puppet/debug/ useful debugging info

VARIABLES FOR EXTENDED MODULES:
$monitor - Set to "yes" to enable auto monitoring classes 
$monitor_tool - Defines the monitor tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
Check fetch-crl/manifests/monitor.pp for more info on fetch-crl monitoring related variables.

$backup - Set to "yes" to enable auto backuping classes 
$backup_tool - Defines the backup tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
Check fetch-crl/manifests/backup.pp for more info on fetch-crl backuping related variables.


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules and the Example42 "common" module.
fetch-crl::conf generic infile configuration define needs the Example42 "common" module
