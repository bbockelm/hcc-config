# lcmaps.db
# 
# This file is used to configure lcmaps, but it might be slightly
# confusing at first glance because it's configured differently when
# you use glexec (usually on worker nodes) and when you configure
# services to use lcmaps for mapping users. 
#
# In general, you need to modify up to three portions of this file
# unless you are doing unusual advanced configurations.
# 
# 1) The gumsclient module definition (in Section 1)
#    This is where you configure the GUMS host you are using. This is
#    true for both glexec and lcmaps for a service. (Ditto for the SAZ
#    host in the sazclient.)
# 2) The glexectracking module (in Section 1)
#    If you are using glexec, uncomment the glexectracking module
#    definition and edit appropriately. You should always uncomment
#    this for glexec but should always leave it commented if you haven't
#    installed glexec. 
# 3) glexec mapping policy (in Section 2)
#    You should select the proper policy for glexec, if you are using glexec.
#    Most sites will use the first policy.
